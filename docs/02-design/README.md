| Document | Focus | Status |

| **[Network Topology](network-topology.md)** | Physical and logical network architecture | ‚úÖ Defined |
| **[Kubernetes Strategy](kubernetes-strategy.md)** | Two-paradigm implementation approach | ‚úÖ Planned |
| **[Security Concept](security-concept.md)** | Enterprise security patterns at lab scale | ‚ö™ Future |
| **[Capability Model](capability-model.md)** | Enterprise capability mapping | ‚úÖ Defined |

## üéØ Design Philosophy

**Bridge Theory and Practice**: Translate enterprise architectural patterns into hands-on learning laboratory that validates theoretical decisions through real implementation.

### Core Principles

**1. Paradigm Comparison**
- Path A: Kubernetes ON Virtualization (traditional)
- Path B: Virtualization IN Kubernetes (cloud-native)
- Scientific approach to fundamental infrastructure decisions

**2. Enterprise Standards at Lab Scale**
- CIA Triad compliance (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Full automation (Infrastructure as Code)
- Proper observability (monitoring, logging, alerting)
- Security by design (encryption, secrets management, RBAC)

**3. Learning-Optimized Architecture**
- Template-driven configuration for paradigm switching
- Comprehensive documentation of decision rationale  
- Real-world validation of architectural assumptions
- Systematic comparison of operational trade-offs

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Two-Path Strategy

**Path A: Kubernetes ON Virtualization**
```
Hardware ‚Üí Proxmox ‚Üí VMs ‚Üí K3s Cluster ‚Üí Container Workloads
```
- Traditional enterprise approach
- Strong isolation boundaries via VMs
- Separate management planes (hypervisor + K8s)
- Higher resource overhead but proven patterns

**Path B: Virtualization IN Kubernetes**
```
Hardware ‚Üí OKD Baremetal ‚Üí OKD Virtualization (KubeVirt)
```
- Cloud-native convergence approach  
- Unified management plane
- Lower resource overhead
- Modern enterprise patterns

### Network Architecture

**Physical Layer**:
- 3x Mini PC nodes (Intel i5-10500T)
- D-Link managed L2 switch
- VLAN segmentation via existing home infrastructure

**Logical Layer**:
- Management network: 10.0.1.0/24 (VLAN 10)
- VM networks: 10.0.2.0/24+ (virtualization layer)
- Pod networks: 172.16.0.0/16 (CNI overlay)
- Service networks: 192.168.0.0/16 (K8s services)

### Technology Stack

**Infrastructure Foundation**:
- Virtualization: Proxmox (Path A) or OKD (Path B)
- Container Orchestration: K3s or OKD/OpenShift
- Networking: Calico/Flannel (Path A) or OVN-Kubernetes (Path B)

**Automation & Operations**:
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform + Ansible
- Secrets Management: HashiCorp Vault
- Observability: Prometheus + Grafana + AlertManager
- GitOps: ArgoCD or OpenShift GitOps

## üîÑ Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Approach

**Phase 1: Foundation** (Current)
- Hardware procurement and assembly
- Network infrastructure setup
- Basic automation framework

**Phase 2: Path A Implementation**
- Proxmox deployment and configuration
- K3s cluster bootstrap
- Basic workload deployment and testing

**Phase 3: Documentation & Automation**
- Complete Infrastructure as Code templates
- Comprehensive monitoring setup
- Operational procedures documentation

**Phase 4: Path B Implementation**
- OKD baremetal deployment
- KubeVirt configuration
- Comparative analysis with Path A

### Learning Methodology

**Scientific Approach**:
1. **Hypothesis**: Architectural assumptions based on theory
2. **Experiment**: Real-world implementation
3. **Observation**: Measure performance, complexity, operational overhead
4. **Documentation**: Capture lessons learned and decision rationale
5. **Iteration**: Refine based on evidence

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Technical Objectives
- **Full Automation**: 100% Infrastructure as Code deployment
- **High Availability**: No single points of failure in critical paths
- **Security Compliance**: Enterprise-grade patterns at lab scale
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### Learning Objectives  
- **Paradigm Mastery**: Deep understanding of both approaches
- **Operational Expertise**: Hands-on experience with enterprise patterns
- **Architectural Validation**: Real-world testing of theoretical decisions
- **Best Practices**: Production-ready knowledge and procedures

### Comparative Analysis
- **Resource Efficiency**: Measure overhead differences between paths
- **Operational Complexity**: Compare management and troubleshooting
- **Performance Characteristics**: Benchmark workload performance
- **Migration Patterns**: Understand transformation challenges

**Design Philosophy**: *"The best architecture is the one you can implement, operate, and explain to others - preferably all three simultaneously."*
