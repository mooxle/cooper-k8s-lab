## 🎯 Overview

This document defines the **core capabilities** required for the Cooper'n'80s learning laboratory, following enterprise architecture best practices. Each capability includes a concise **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** explaining the rationale behind implementation choices.

**Architecture Philosophy**: *Capabilities drive component selection, not the reverse.*

## 🏗️ Capability Domain Model

### Infrastructure Foundation Capabilities

#### 1. **Compute Virtualization**
**Capability**: Provide isolated compute environments with dynamic resource allocation

**ADR-001**: Selected **Hypervisor-based virtualization** (Proxmox/OKD) over containers-only approach.  
**Rationale**: Learning objective requires understanding traditional enterprise patterns. VMs provide stronger isolation for multi-tenant scenarios and enable comparison between virtualization paradigms.  
**Trade-off**: Higher resource overhead vs. educational value and enterprise realism.

#### 2. **Container Orchestration**  
**Capability**: Deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications with enterprise patterns

**ADR-002**: Chose **Kubernetes** (K3s/OKD) over Docker Swarm or Nomad.  
**Rationale**: Kubernetes is the de-facto enterprise standard with the richest ecosystem. Learning investment provides maximum career value and enterprise applicability.  
**Trade-off**: Higher complexity vs. industry standard adoption and feature completeness.

#### 3. **Software-Defined Networking**
**Capability**: Programmable network infrastructure with overlay networking and micro-segmentation

**ADR-003**: Implemented **CNI-based overlay networks** (Calico/OVN-Kubernetes) over traditional VLAN-only approach.  
**Rationale**: Modern enterprises require programmable networking. Overlay networks enable advanced features like network policies and service mesh integration.  
**Trade-off**: Additional complexity vs. cloud-native networking patterns and advanced security capabilities.

### Data & Storage Capabilities

#### 4. **Persistent Data Management**
**Capability**: Reliable storage with backup, recovery, and lifecycle management

**ADR-004**: Selected **Local NVMe + Distributed Storage** pattern over centralized NAS-only.  
**Rationale**: Provides experience with both local high-performance storage and distributed storage patterns common in cloud environments.  
**Trade-off**: Management complexity vs. performance diversity and cloud-native storage patterns.

#### 5. **Secrets Management**
**Capability**: Centralized credential storage with encryption, rotation, and access control

**ADR-005**: Implemented **HashiCorp Vault** over Kubernetes native secrets.  
**Rationale**: Enterprise-grade secrets management with advanced features like dynamic secrets, PKI, and extensive integrations. Provides real-world enterprise patterns experience.  
**Trade-off**: Additional infrastructure complexity vs. enterprise security standards and compliance capabilities.

### Network Services Capabilities

**Capability**: Automatic service registration and DNS-based discovery

**ADR-006**: Deployed **Enterprise DNS/DHCP stack** (PowerDNS + Kea) over simple router-based DHCP.  
**Rationale**: Provides experience with enterprise network services patterns. Automatic service discovery enables seamless integration between infrastructure layers and applications.  
**Trade-off**: Operational complexity vs. enterprise networking patterns and automatic service integration.

#### 7. **Load Balancing & Traffic Management**  
**Capability**: Distribute traffic and provide service endpoints with health checking

**ADR-007**: Planning **MetalLB + Ingress Controllers** approach over external load balancer.  
**Rationale**: Cloud-native load balancing patterns integrated with Kubernetes. Provides experience with modern traffic management approaches.  
**Trade-off**: Limited to lab network vs. integrated Kubernetes traffic management and enterprise ingress patterns.

### Security & Compliance Capabilities

#### 8. **Identity & Access Management**
**Capability**: Authentication, authorization, and audit across all systems

**ADR-008**: Implementing **RBAC + Service Accounts** pattern with Vault integration.  
**Rationale**: Kubernetes-native RBAC provides fine-grained access control. Integration with Vault enables enterprise identity patterns and secure service-to-service communication.  
**Trade-off**: Configuration complexity vs. enterprise security posture and compliance readiness.

#### 9. **Network Security**
**Capability**: Network segmentation, policies, and traffic filtering  

**ADR-009**: Adopted **Network Policies + Service Mesh** approach over perimeter-only security.  
**Rationale**: Zero-trust networking principles align with modern security architecture. Micro-segmentation provides defense in depth and supports compliance requirements.  
**Trade-off**: Implementation complexity vs. modern security architecture and zero-trust capabilities.

### Observability & Operations Capabilities

#### 10. **Infrastructure Monitoring**
**Capability**: Collect, store, and analyze infrastructure and application metrics

**ADR-010**: Selected **Prometheus + Grafana** ecosystem over commercial APM solutions.  
**Rationale**: Open-source observability stack provides enterprise-grade capabilities with extensive Kubernetes integration. Aligns with cloud-native monitoring patterns.  
**Trade-off**: Configuration effort vs. cost efficiency and cloud-native monitoring patterns.

#### 11. **Log Management** 
**Capability**: Centralized logging with search, analysis, and retention

**ADR-011**: Planning **ELK/EFK Stack** deployment over simple log files.  
**Rationale**: Enterprise logging patterns require centralized collection and analysis. Provides experience with log aggregation at scale and compliance logging.  
**Trade-off**: Resource consumption vs. enterprise logging capabilities and compliance support.

#### 12. **Backup & Disaster Recovery**
**Capability**: Data protection, recovery procedures, and business continuity

**ADR-012**: Implementing **Multi-layer Backup Strategy** (VM snapshots + application-level backups).  
**Rationale**: Enterprise DR requires multiple recovery points and methods. Provides experience with both infrastructure and application-level backup strategies.  
**Trade-off**: Storage overhead vs. comprehensive disaster recovery and enterprise compliance requirements.

### Development & Automation Capabilities

#### 13. **Infrastructure as Code**
**Capability**: Declarative infrastructure management with version control and automation

**ADR-013**: Adopted **Terraform + Ansible** combination over single-tool approach.  
**Rationale**: Terraform excels at resource provisioning, Ansible at configuration management. Combination provides comprehensive infrastructure automation capabilities.  
**Trade-off**: Tool complexity vs. best-of-breed automation capabilities and enterprise standard adoption.

#### 14. **CI/CD Pipeline**
**Capability**: Automated build, test, and deployment workflows

**ADR-014**: Planning **GitOps** approach with ArgoCD/Flux over traditional CI/CD.  
**Rationale**: GitOps aligns with Kubernetes-native deployment patterns. Provides experience with modern deployment methodologies and infrastructure drift detection.  
**Trade-off**: Kubernetes-specific vs. modern deployment patterns and configuration drift management.

#### 15. **Configuration Management Database (CMDB)**
**Capability**: Centralized infrastructure documentation and relationship tracking

**ADR-015**: Implemented **YAML-based CMDB** with NetBox migration path over immediate commercial CMDB.  
**Rationale**: Git-native approach enables version control and automation integration. Provides foundation for enterprise CMDB patterns without immediate tool overhead.  
**Trade-off**: Manual maintenance vs. version-controlled infrastructure documentation and automation integration.

## 🎭 Enterprise Architecture Principles

> *"Every component decision should map to a business capability requirement. If it doesn't improve a capability, it's technology for technology's sake."*

**Capability-Driven Selection**: Components chosen to fulfill specific enterprise capabilities, not based on technology preferences.

**Enterprise Patterns**: Each capability implements patterns common in enterprise environments, providing transferable knowledge.

**Scientific Validation**: Architecture decisions tested through real implementation, documenting what works vs. theoretical assumptions.
