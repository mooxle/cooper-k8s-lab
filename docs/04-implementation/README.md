# Implementation & Deployment

> Infrastructure as Code and automated deployment strategies

## 🚧 Section Under Development

This section will contain the complete Infrastructure as Code implementation for both architectural paths:

## 🎯 Implementation Philosophy

**Infrastructure as Code**: Every component deployed through automated, version-controlled templates  
**Scientific Methodology**: Both paths implemented identically for fair comparison  
**Enterprise Patterns**: Production-ready configurations at lab scale

## 📊 Current Status

- **🔧 Hardware Phase**: Frame assembly complete, equipment mounting in progress
- **📋 Planning Phase**: Automation strategies being researched
- **⚪ Implementation Phase**: Pending hardware completion

## 🔮 Coming Soon

### **Phase 1: Path A Implementation**
- Proxmox automated installation and configuration
- K3s cluster bootstrap with Ansible
- Basic workload deployment and testing

### **Phase 2: Documentation & Automation**
- Complete Infrastructure as Code templates
- Monitoring and observability stack
- Operational procedures and runbooks

### **Phase 3: Path B Implementation**
- OKD bare metal deployment automation
- KubeVirt configuration and testing
- Comparative analysis framework
