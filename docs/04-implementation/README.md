# Implementation & Deployment

> Infrastructure as Code and automated deployment strategies

## 🚧 Section Under Development

This section will contain the complete Infrastructure as Code implementation for both architectural paths:

## 🎯 Implementation Philosophy

**Infrastructure as Code**: Every component deployed through automated, version-controlled templates  
**Scientific Methodology**: Both paths implemented identically for fair comparison  
**Enterprise Patterns**: Production-ready configurations at lab scale

## 🌐 Network Services Foundation (COMPLETED)

**Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** - Enterprise DNS/DHCP infrastructure deployed

### Cooper DNS/DHCP Stack
**Deployment**: Docker Compose orchestrated network services
- **PowerDNS Authoritative**: cooper.lab domain authority
- **PowerDNS Recursor**: Recursive DNS with upstream forwarding  
- **Kea DHCP4**: Dynamic IP assignment with DDNS integration
- **PowerDNS Admin**: Web-based DNS management
- **Dynamic DNS**: Automatic A/PTR record creation

### Network Integration
**Lab VLAN Support**: 10.0.1.0/24 with automatic service discovery
- **DHCP Pool**: 10.0.1.100-200 
- **DNS Domain**: cooper.lab (authoritative)
- **Service Registration**: Automatic hostname → IP mapping
- **Upstream DNS**: Pi-hole integration for external resolution

### Enterprise Patterns
**Production-Ready Infrastructure**:
- Complete operational procedures documented
- Health monitoring and troubleshooting workflows
- Vault integration prepared for secrets management
- Container orchestration with Docker Compose

**Ready for Kubernetes**: Network infrastructure foundation complete for cluster deployment
