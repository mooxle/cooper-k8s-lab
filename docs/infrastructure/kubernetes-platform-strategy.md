# Kubernetes Platform Strategy

> Architectural approach and distribution analysis for Cooper'n'80s lab infrastructure.

## 📋 Executive Cooper Summary

> 🤓 *"I don't just want to learn Kubernetes - I want to understand the fundamental architectural decisions that make or break enterprise platforms."*

**The Strategy:**
Two fundamentally different paradigms, both fully automated and switchable for paradigm comparison:

- **Path A**: Kubernetes ON Virtualization (Proxmox + K3s)
- **Path B**: Virtualization IN Kubernetes (OKD Baremetal + KubeVirt)

**The Paradigm Question:**
Do we treat virtualization as infrastructure foundation or as Kubernetes workload? Each path represents a completely different philosophical approach to modern infrastructure.

**The Scientific Approach:**
Template-driven configuration enables switching between paradigms to experience the fundamental architectural trade-offs firsthand.

**Why This Matters:**
- Experience the **paradigm shift** from "VMs first, K8s second" to "K8s first, VMs as workload"
- Learn **traditional enterprise** (layered virtualization) vs **cloud-native** (unified orchestration) approaches  
- Master **infrastructure automation** that enables philosophical architecture switching
- Understand **real-world implications** of fundamental infrastructure paradigm choices

**Bottom Line:** This laboratory explores the most fundamental question in modern infrastructure: Should virtualization be the foundation that runs Kubernetes, or should Kubernetes be the foundation that runs virtualization?

## 🛤️ Architectural Path Analysis

### The Fundamental Paradigm Difference

**Path A: Kubernetes ON Virtualization**
- Virtualization provides the foundation
- Kubernetes runs as a guest on virtual machines
- Two separate management planes: hypervisor + K8s orchestrator

**Path B: Virtualization IN Kubernetes**  
- Kubernetes provides the foundation
- Virtualization runs as a Kubernetes workload via KubeVirt
- Single management plane: Kubernetes orchestrates everything

> 🤓 *"The difference isn't just technical - it's philosophical. Do we treat virtualization as infrastructure or as workload?"*

### Path A: Kubernetes ON Virtualization

```
Hardware → Proxmox → VMs → K3s Cluster → Container Workloads
```

**Architecture Benefits:**
✅ **Proven Approach** - Well-understood virtualization layer
✅ **Hardware Abstraction** - VM portability and live migration
✅ **Multi-Tenant Safe** - Strong VM isolation boundaries
✅ **Flexible Sizing** - Easy VM resource adjustment
✅ **Recovery Options** - VM snapshots and backups

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Traditional enterprise virtualization patterns
- Multi-layer resource management (Proxmox + K8s)
- VM-based cluster node management
- Storage and networking through virtualization layer

**Resource Overhead:**
```bash
Hardware → Proxmox (~1GB RAM, 0.5 CPU per node)
         → VM Guest OS (~1GB RAM, 0.3 CPU per VM)  
         → K3s Services (~800MB RAM, 0.4 CPU per node)
Total Overhead: ~40-50% of base resources
```

### Path B: Virtualization IN Kubernetes

```
Hardware → OKD Baremetal → OKD Virtualization (KubeVirt)
```

**Architecture Benefits:**
✅ **Unified Management** - Single control plane for VMs and containers
✅ **Enterprise Native** - OpenShift/OKD production patterns
✅ **Advanced Features** - Live migration, unified networking (OVN-K8s)
✅ **Cloud-like Experience** - Kubernetes-native virtualization
✅ **Lower Overhead** - No hypervisor layer between hardware and K8s

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Cloud-native virtualization with KubeVirt
- Enterprise Kubernetes platform (OpenShift/OKD)
- Unified container + VM orchestration
- Advanced networking (OVN-Kubernetes, service mesh)

**Resource Overhead:**
```bash
Hardware → OKD Control Plane (~2GB RAM, 1 CPU per master)
         → KubeVirt (~500MB RAM, 0.2 CPU overhead)
         → VM Workloads (direct allocation)
Total Overhead: ~25-35% of base resources
```

## 🎯 Kubernetes Distribution Analysis

### Distribution Comparison Matrix

| Distribution | Resource Overhead | Enterprise Features | Learning Value | Homelab Fit | Automation Friendly |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **K3s** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **MicroK8s** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **kubeadm** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **K0s** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **OKD** | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### Path-Specific Distribution Recommendations

#### Path A (Proxmox + K8s): K3s or MicroK8s
**K3s - Recommended for Path A:**
```bash
Strengths:
+ Minimal overhead on VMs
+ Excellent automation support  
+ Battle-tested in edge/IoT scenarios
+ Simple networking (good for VM-to-VM)

VM Requirements per Node:
- Control+Worker: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM
- Pure Worker: 2 vCPU, 6GB RAM
```

**MicroK8s - Alternative for Path A:**
```bash
Strengths:
+ Snap-based simplicity
+ Good Ubuntu integration
+ Built-in add-ons system

Considerations:
- Higher overhead than K3s
- Snap dependency may complicate automation
```

#### Path B (Baremetal OKD): Native OKD
**OKD - Required for Path B:**
```bash
Strengths:
+ Enterprise OpenShift features
+ Native KubeVirt integration
+ Advanced networking (OVN-Kubernetes)
+ Multi-tenancy and security features

Hardware Requirements:
- Master Nodes: 4+ vCPU, 16GB+ RAM
- Worker Nodes: 2+ vCPU, 8GB+ RAM  
- Storage: 120GB+ per node
```

## 🔄 Conceptual Switching Strategy

### Infrastructure Transformation Approach

The goal is not necessarily full automation of OS deployment (which presents significant complexity), but rather a **structured approach to architectural experimentation**:

**Conceptual Workflow:**
```bash
Deploy Path A → Experiment → Document Learnings → 
Wipe Environment → Deploy Path B → Compare Results
```

**Template-Driven Configuration:**
- **Infrastructure as Code** templates for each path
- **Declarative configurations** that capture architectural decisions  
- **Systematic documentation** of setup procedures and learnings
- **Reproducible deployments** through documented automation

**Learning Through Iteration:**
```
Iteration 1: Manual deployment, document every step
Iteration 2: Semi-automated scripts, reduce manual effort
Iteration 3: Refined automation, focus on comparison metrics
Iteration 4: Template-driven deployment, architectural switching
```

### The Meta-Learning Value

The switching process itself becomes a learning opportunity:
- Understanding deployment complexity differences
- Comparing operational overhead between approaches  
- Experiencing migration challenges between paradigms
- Building expertise in infrastructure automation patterns

> 🔬 *"Sometimes the journey between architectures teaches you more than the destinations themselves."*

## 🎯 Conclusion: Architectural Experimentation

### Why Both Paradigms Matter

**Path A (K8s ON Virtualization)** teaches:
- Traditional enterprise infrastructure patterns
- Separation of concerns between compute and orchestration
- Mature, battle-tested deployment approaches

**Path B (Virtualization IN K8s)** teaches:
- Cloud-native infrastructure convergence
- Unified platform management paradigms
- Next-generation enterprise approaches

### The Learning Value

> 🔬 *"The real experiment isn't 'How do I run Kubernetes?' - it's 'How do different infrastructure paradigms affect everything from resource efficiency to operational philosophy?'"*

**Core Learning Objectives:**
- Experience both infrastructure paradigms firsthand
- Understand trade-offs between layered vs unified approaches  
- Develop practical automation and deployment expertise
- Build confidence in making architectural decisions based on real experience

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1**: Path A implementation (K8s ON Virtualization) - lower complexity, proven patterns
**Phase 2**: Documentation and automation framework development
**Phase 3**: Path B implementation (Virtualization IN K8s) - higher complexity, cutting-edge patterns  
**Phase 4**: Comparative analysis and architectural insights

**Final Thought:** This lab becomes a **paradigm comparison laboratory** where the fundamental infrastructure philosophy is the primary learning objective.
