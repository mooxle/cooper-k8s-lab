| **[Learning Goals](learning-goals.md)** | What skills and knowledge this project targets |

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

This homelab exists to **bridge the gap** between Enterprise Architecture theory and hands-on implementation reality. Built by an Enterprise Architect who wants to deepen practical expertise in domains where I typically orchestrate rather than implement.

## ðŸ§ª Core Philosophy

> *"In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not."*

**Scientific Approach**:
1. **Hypothesis** - Architectural decisions based on enterprise patterns
2. **Experiment** - Real-world implementation 
3. **Observation** - Document what actually works vs theory
4. **Iteration** - Refine based on evidence

## ðŸŽ­ The Cooper Factor

> *"I don't have OCD. I have a condition called Obsessive Compulsive Order - which is completely different."*

This lab aims for **enterprise-grade standards** even at homelab scale:
- Full automation (Infrastructure as Code)
- Proper security (encryption, secrets management, RBAC)
- High availability patterns (no single points of failure)
- Complete observability (monitoring, logging, alerting)

## ðŸ”„ Two-Paradigm Strategy

**Path A**: Kubernetes ON Virtualization (Proxmox + K3s)  
**Path B**: Virtualization IN Kubernetes (OKD + KubeVirt)

This enables **paradigm comparison** - experiencing the fundamental architectural trade-offs between treating virtualization as infrastructure foundation vs Kubernetes workload.

## ðŸ“š Navigation

**Next Steps**:
- [Architecture Decisions](architecture.md) - Deep dive into technical philosophy
- [Learning Goals](learning-goals.md) - Specific skills and outcomes targeted
- [Design Section](../02-design/) - See how vision translates to architecture

---

**Bottom Line**: This isn't just about learning Kubernetes - it's about understanding the fundamental infrastructure decisions that shape enterprise technology platforms.
