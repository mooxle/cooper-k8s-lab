## 🤖 GenAI Collaboration (Claude AI)

**Content Limits & RAG Solution**
- Claude hits content limits in long conversations
- Consolidating previous chats via document uploads brings back full context
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) extends effective conversation length

**Iteration is Critical**
- Important to iterate and verify results
- Problem: MD files not always updated correctly 
- Solution: Follow-up prompts find the problem and restructure properly
- Always check if changes were actually applied

## 🔧 Technical Discoveries

**Cat7 Keystone Adapters**
- Only available in silver finish
- Cat6a would be available in other colors (including black)
- Trade-off: Performance vs. aesthetics for rack design

**3D Printed Keystone Panel Design Gap**
- Current 3D printable keystone panels have no cable management
- No mounting points for cable ties to secure cables
- Need to develop solution for this
