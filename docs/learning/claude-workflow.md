# Claude AI Workflow

> How I work with Claude AI on this project.

## 🤖 Setup

**AI Assistant**: Claude AI (Anthropic)  
**Communication**: Text + Screenshots  
**Tools**: VS Code Paste Image (Cmd+Alt+V)  

## 🔄 Workflow

### Typical Pattern
1. **Me**: Share problem/topic
2. **Claude**: Suggest structure or solution
3. **Me**: Provide specific details/constraints  
4. **Claude**: Create/adjust content
5. **Me**: Review in VS Code split-view
6. **Me**: Screenshot feedback to Claude
7. **Claude**: Refine based on visual feedback
8. **Me**: Implement and commit

### Communication Methods

| Method | When Used | Effectiveness |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Screenshots** | Document review, layout feedback | ✅ High |
| **Copy/Paste** | Code, long text, configurations | ✅ High |
| **Discussion** | Decisions, concepts, alternatives | ✅ Medium |

## ⚖️ Division of Work

**Claude handles**: Structure, technical accuracy, comprehensive coverage  
**I handle**: Specific details, final decisions, implementation, personal voice  

## 📊 What Works / What Doesn't

### ✅ Works Well
- Screenshot-based review with VS Code split-view
- Specific questions with context
- Iterative refinement (2-3 rounds typical)
- Template-first approach

### ❌ Doesn't Work
- Vague requests without context
- Claude making assumptions about my setup
- Over-detailed solutions for simple problems
- Long explanations when I need quick answers

## 🎯 Current Status

**Effectiveness**: High for technical documentation  
**Efficiency**: ~5 minutes to first draft, 2-3 iterations to final  
**Learning curve**: Ongoing improvement in prompt specificity
