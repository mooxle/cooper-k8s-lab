## ðŸ¤– GenAI Collaboration (Claude AI)

**Content Limits & RAG Solution**
- Claude hits content limits in long conversations
- Consolidating previous chats via document uploads brings back full context
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) extends effective conversation length

**Iteration is Critical**
- Important to iterate and verify results
- Problem: MD files not always updated correctly 
- Solution: Follow-up prompts find the problem and restructure properly
- Always check if changes were actually applied

## ðŸ”§ Technical Discoveries

**Cat7 Keystone Adapters**
- Only available in silver finish
- Cat6a would be available in other colors (including black)
- Trade-off: Performance vs. aesthetics for rack design

**3D Printed Keystone Panel Design Gap**
- Current 3D printable keystone panels have no cable management
- No mounting points for cable ties to secure cables
- Need to develop solution for this

**Rack Layout Optimization**
- 0.5U patch panel enables better equipment spacing
- Mini PCs elevated (2.5U+) for improved thermal management  
- Hidden infrastructure zone (1U-2U) with front covers for professional appearance
- Separation of visible equipment from cable management improves serviceability


**1.5U Panel Height Calculation**
- Custom 1.5U panels have 5mm gap at top - minor measurement discrepancy
- Tinkercad measurements: 1.5U = 66.75mm, 5U = 222.25mm 
- Possible scaling differences between import/export tools
- Functional impact: None - purely aesthetic gap

**Print Orientation Learning**
- Handles require reprinting with corrected orientation
- Wrong orientation resulted in poor surface finish
- Lesson: Test print orientation for non-structural decorative elements
