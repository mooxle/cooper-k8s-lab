## 🎯 Operations Philosophy

**Proactive Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability before problems occur  
**Documented Procedures**: Every operational task has a documented runbook  
**Enterprise Standards**: Production-grade operational practices at lab scale

## 📊 Current Status

- **🔧 Hardware Phase**: Physical infrastructure being completed
- **⚪ Deployment Phase**: Pending infrastructure automation completion
- **⚪ Operations Phase**: Will begin after successful system deployment

## 🔮 Coming Soon

### **Monitoring & Observability**
- Prometheus metrics collection and storage
- Grafana dashboards for infrastructure and applications
- AlertManager notification routing and escalation

### **Troubleshooting Procedures**
- Common failure scenarios and resolution steps
- Log aggregation and analysis workflows
- Performance debugging methodologies

### **Maintenance Procedures**
- Regular backup and recovery testing
- Security patching and vulnerability management
- Capacity planning and resource optimization
