## 🎯 Project Concept

This is my personal learning journey to build a Kubernetes homelab from scratch. Every step, every decision, and every mistake will be documented here for my own reference and hopefully to help others on the same path.

**The Plan:**
- **Self-printed 10-inch rack** - Custom designed for my specific needs
- **3 physical nodes** - Mini PCs providing the compute foundation  
- **Proxmox as baseline platform** - Virtualization layer for flexibility
- **Kubernetes nodes as VMs** - Container orchestration on virtual machines
- **Underlay and overlay networking** - Proper network segmentation and routing
- **Security** - Access control, encryption at rest, and secrets management

## 🧪 Learning Approach

This is fundamentally a **learning project**. I'm using this repository to:

- Document my thought process and decision-making
- Track what works and what doesn't
- Build knowledge step by step
- Create a reference for future me
- Share discoveries with the community

**Scientific Method Applied:**
1. **Hypothesis** - What I think will work
2. **Experiment** - Implementation and testing  
3. **Observation** - What actually happened
4. **Documentation** - Lessons learned for next iteration

*"The best thing about being a scientist is that you get to be wrong professionally."* - Probably something Sheldon would say

## 📚 Documentation Structure

The project will grow organically. Current areas:

- **Hardware** - Physical components and 3D printed rack
- **Infrastructure** - Proxmox setup and networking
- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration layer
- **Automation** - Making it all reproducible
- **Lessons Learned** - What I discovered along the way

## 🚀 Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- [x] Concept definition
- [ ] 3D printing custom rack
- [ ] Hardware procurement
- [ ] Initial documentation

*"I'm not insane, my mother had me tested. I'm just building infrastructure."*
