## 🎯 Project Overview

Enterprise-grade Kubernetes homelab for hands-on learning with enterprise technologies. Built by an Enterprise Architect to bridge the gap between architecture theory and operational reality.

> 🤓 *"If I'm going to have a lab, it's going to be theoretically and practically perfect."*

**Core Components:**
- Self-printed 10-inch rack with 3 mini PC nodes
- Proxmox virtualization with Kubernetes VMs  
- Full automation (Terraform, Ansible, GitOps)
- Enterprise security (encryption, secrets management)
- AI-assisted development workflow

**Learning Focus:** Infrastructure as Code, container orchestration, network automation, and modern DevOps practices.

## 🧪 Learning Approach

This is fundamentally a **learning project**. I'm using this repository to:

- Document my thought process and decision-making
- Track what works and what doesn't
- Build knowledge step by step
- Create a reference for future me
- Share discoveries with the community

**Scientific Method Applied:**
1. **Hypothesis** - What I think will work
2. **Experiment** - Implementation and testing  
3. **Observation** - What actually happened
4. **Documentation** - Lessons learned for next iteration

> 🔬 *"The best thing about being a scientist is that you get to be wrong professionally."*
