# Getting Started with Cooper'n'80s

## 👋 Welcome

This project documents building an **enterprise-grade Kubernetes homelab** from an Enterprise Architect's perspective. It's about bridging the gap between architectural theory and hands-on implementation.

## 🎯 What You'll Find

**Focus**: Learning through building - not just reading about it  
**Approach**: Scientific method applied to infrastructure decisions  
**Outcome**: Production-ready skills in miniature enterprise environment

### Current Infrastructure Status

🌐 **Network Services**: OPERATIONAL at 10.0.1.23 (ipam.cooper.lab)  
🔗 **VXLAN Overlay**: Full EVPN/VXLAN mesh between nodes  
🔐 **Storage Security**: TPM-backed ZFS encryption operational  
🚀 **K8s Foundation**: Ready for cluster deployment

## 🚀 Quick Context

**The Lab**: 3-node Kubernetes cluster in custom 3D-printed rack  
**The Learning**: Two different infrastructure paradigms (K8s on VMs vs VMs in K8s)  
**The Goal**: Master enterprise patterns through real implementation
